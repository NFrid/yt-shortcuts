# YouTube Shortcuts

Extended and configurable shortcuts for YouTube.

The extension is deadass simple and is basically a userscript that can be
configured by chrome's shortcuts system.

## Current features

- Like/dislike/unlike the video:
  - Like (default `Alt+L`) likes the video
  - Dislike (default `Alt+J`) dislikes the video
  - Unlike (default `Alt+K`) clears like/dislike
- Toggle Sub (default `Alt+M`) toggles subscription button
- Set Notification Bell to All/Personalized/None

## Configuration

Go [Chrome's shortcuts settings](chrome://extensions/shortcuts) and edit
shortcuts for YouTube Shortcuts.

Also you can click on the icon of the extension to go there.

## Planned features

- idk make an issue if you miss something
