# YouTube Shortcuts

Extended and configurable shortcuts for YouTube.

The extension is deadass simple and is basically a userscript that can be
configured by chrome's shortcuts system.

## Current features

- Like/dislike/unlike the video:
  - Like (default `Alt+L`) like the video
  - Dislike (default `Alt+J`) dislike the video
  - Unlike (default `Alt+K`) clears like/dislike

## Configuration

Go [chrome://extensions/shortcuts](chrome://extensions/shortcuts) and edit
shortcuts for YouTube Shortcuts.

## Planned features

- idk make an issue if you miss something

## Credits

[avi12](https://avi12.com/) provided me with code I was lazy to implement by myself.
Here's the project I looked up the main logic: [youtube-like-dislike-shortcut](https://github.com/avi12/youtube-like-dislike-shortcut).
